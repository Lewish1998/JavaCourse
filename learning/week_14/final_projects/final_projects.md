# Final Projects

## Brief


* Create your own brief **OR** go with a pre-written brief (we'll give them out next Thursday) ?‚úÖ
* Chat and share your project ideas in slack  ‚úÖ
* Start working on your projects next Friday (or Thursday if you're ready)
* Send the instructors your repo' links!
  * Add your brief into the root README.md file for the repo. 
  * One repo for your entire project
* Work until Wednesday or Thursday (if you dare - just make sure it works for the pres' üòâ )
* Presentations on Thursday/Friday(depending on the number of groups) - **please send us your song**
* Choose your own team - no bigger than 4 + **no repeated teams from previous projects**
* Solo is an option - by all means

## Rules

### Tech

* Choose your own tech stack - but we **strongly** encourage full stack with Java on the back-end. 
* We heavily encourage 3rd party libraries of all kinds for JS or Java - you choose. Explore some ideas - we're **really** keen to see what you find. If you do, it makes a great topic for the presentation. Examples include ( see "awesome" lists below for even more inspiration )
  * MongoDB for JPA
  * Reactive for Spring Boot
  * Socket.IO / RSocket / WebSockets etc
  * Semantic UI for React
  * Bootstrap for React
  * Styled Components for React
* Be careful with things like ReactNative and Swift - they are fun but can often take longer to build with than we have time for. 


## Project Ideas

If you go with your own idea you must:

* Complete a brief that details the MVP and extensions.
* Be extremely careful to not bite off more than you can handle - but being adventurous 
* Show it to instructors for sign-off


### Notice Board

If you (individually) have an idea for a project and would like to be in a group, we'd love it if you could advertise or pitch your idea to recruit other students to your project. Sell your idea and be open to suggestions on how it could be mixed around and changed. **We would love to see a hive of activity on slack discussing this  - get pitching :D**

Even if you don't have an idea, but maybe want to work on a particular technology or library - please bring along your thoughts and share with others as there could be a really good match. Tell people what tech you want to work on if there's something that takes your fancy  and feel free to share that on slack, too.

## Custom Project Extensions

* Use an external API - but not allowed to call it from your client. You can use an external API but only if you pull the data into your own back-end and use it from there. (exceptions are things like stripe, twilio, sendgrid)
