## Mob programming - Lab

> Instructor notes for the day.

So for this lab we are going to do a bit of mob programming to consolidate the learning from last week.

What will be created will be the instructors choice but there are a few options with solutions available.

If you choose something different please create a pull request and add the solution to the repo.

Options so far are:

- BlackJack

- Vending Machine (Have seen this used for code tests in interviews.)



### Plan

Spend some time with the students planning out the project.

Go through class diagrams, methods and properties.


### TDD

Create the project using TDD to reenforce this with students.


### GIT

Usually up until now git commits from students are thin on the ground. use this as an opportunity to show proper use of regular git commits with meaningfull messages.
